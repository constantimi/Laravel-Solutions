# Web Development (WAD)  - Advanced Phase

During the advanced phase of the Web Application Development (WAD) course, we will be focusing on back-
end web development with PHP Framework called **Laravel**. 
With this framework, we are going to create a **multiuser web application**
with “dynamic” content containing **text and images** (reviews, recipes, live hacks, forum posts,
events, etc.)

After completing this phase of the module we will be able to:
- Set up a development environment for Laravel web applications.
- Explain how the **MVC** is implemented and how it works.
- Use Composer (**package manager**).
- Use **Artisan** to enhance your development experience (**scaffolding, migration, cache cleaning**, etc.)
- Create an **environment configuration** file for the respective environments.
- Create a **controller** with actions with appropriate responses.
- Use **Blade** to create views, layouts and partial views. (**view engine**)
- Create a models.
- Bind a model to a form in the view.
- Implement **model validation** by making use of Laravel Validation class.
- Use **Eloquent** to query the database for models **(ORM)**.
- Use **migration** and **seeding** files to populate a database with tables and initial content.
- Create **authentication and authorization** functionality by making use of the built-in features of
Laravel. (example : `php artisan make:auth`)
- Create **file upload** functionalities in Laravel.

## Way of Working

The approach used in this course is **Learning-by-doing**, therefore this course is highly self-study oriented.
Besides classes, the student will have to spend a **minimum of 8 hours** (self-study) in the matter per week.
We must commit your work at least on weekly basis in
**GitLab**. It is important that you show consistent learning and improvement.

## About Laravel

- Creating controller & models

`$ php artisan help migrate` 

`$ php artisan make:controller TodosController` *shoud be plural 

`$ php artisan make:model Todo -m` *shoud be singular 

`$ php artisan make:migration add_todos_to_db -table` 

`$ php artisan migrate`
