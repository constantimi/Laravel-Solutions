# Web Development (WAD)  - Advanced Phase

## Description

During the advanced phase of the Web Application Development (WAD) course, we will be focusing on back-
end web development (PHP and MySQL). You will also be applying previously learnt knowledge about front-
end during this phase, however, no new techniques will be taught. During this phase you are required to
make use of the PHP Framework called Laravel. With this framework, you are to create a multiuser web
application with “dynamic” content containing text and images (reviews, recipes, live hacks, forum posts,
events, POI, etc.)

## Learning goals

After completing this phase of the module you will be able to:
- Install a development environment for developing Laravel web applications.
- Explain how the MVC is implemented in Laravel and how the model, controller and view work
together.
-  Use Composer.
- Use Artisan to enhance your development experience(scaffolding, migration, cache cleaning, etc.)
- Create an ‘environment configuration’ file for the respective environments.
- Create a controller with actions with appropriate responses.
- Use Blade to create views, layouts and partial views.
- Judge which routes should be created in your Laravel web applications.
- Create a model.
- Bind a model to a form in the view.
- Implement model validation by making use of Laravel Validation class.
- Use Eloquent to query the database for models.
- Use Eloquent to do CRUD actions for model to a database.
- Use migration and seeding files to populate a database with tables and initial content.
- Create authentication and authorization functionality by making use of the built-in features of
Laravel.
- Create file upload functionalities in Laravel.
- Enabling user to view and update the uploaded files

## Way of Working

The approach used in this course is Learning-by-doing, therefore this course is highly self-study oriented.
Besides classes, the student will have to spend a minimum of 8 hours (self-study) in the matter per week.
The theory lectures explain what a certain technology is, the purpose of it and the essentials on how to use
it. It is the student’s task to go deeper and study further in detail such technologies (see resources section)
so that he/she is better prepared to tackle the assignment.

Since web development is mainly a collaborative process you will work in groups of two. It is also an
incremental and iterative process, so you are expected to work regularly on it and periodically discuss your
work with the teacher, and incorporate feedback. You must commit your work at least on weekly basis in
Git. It is important that you show consistent learning and improvement.


## Course Planning

You will be learning by doing. Bellow you will find recommended activities each week so that you are on

track and you cover all the criteria. **Do not delay for later and when possible try to go ahead by yourself**.
You will receive all the necesarry guidance during lecture, however you will have to research on your own as

well. Each activity has a topic and each topic has a reference to the laravel documentation. **Do not treat the
official documentation of Laravel as a walkthrough.**
